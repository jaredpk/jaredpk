## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I am currently in ATMS 523 at the University of Illinos.
## This is part of a larger initiative to gain a certificate (and possibly continuing to a masters degree) as part of the Weather and Climate Risk and Data Analytics program.
## I have worked in data and analytics and business intelligence since 2014.
## Weather and climate have been lifelong interestes of mine, so this program merges that interest with professional experience.
